# Multimodal Training Data Release with Vane

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Build a typed release table from document, text, image, and audio assets with Vane Relations and Python batch UDFs. Each modality runs in its own typed branch; RayRunner materializes the branches as type-compatible Parquet before Relation filters, aggregations, and writers produce release and rejection artifacts.

The default run uses five pinned public files from Apache Arrow and Wikimedia Commons. It verifies their catalog, source manifest, and payload hashes before processing, then releases four records and rejects one low-resolution SVG. The lightweight processors cover UTF-8 text, SVG dimensions, and PCM WAV metadata.

## Vane Data Focus

- Filter one input Relation into four modality branches, materialize them with RayRunner, and combine their type-compatible Parquet outputs.
- Run Python processors through `map_batches` with a shared Arrow schema and RayRunner's default `ray_task` backend or an explicitly selected task backend.
- Use Relation aggregations and writers to produce typed Parquet releases, reviewable CSV summaries, and a JSON execution manifest.

## Quick Start

Python 3.12 and uv are used for the validated setup. Vane 0.1.0 and its dependencies are resolved from PyPI.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install 'vane-ai==0.1.0'
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip check
.venv/bin/python src/multimodal_training_data.py
```

The default run writes Parquet, CSV, and JSON artifacts under `output/multimodal_training_data`. It should process five records, release four, and reject one low-resolution validation image.

Run the focused test suite with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests \
  -p 'test_multimodal_training_data.py' -v
```

## Public Data Snapshot

The checked-in snapshot contains:

- two Apache Arrow README files under Apache-2.0;
- two Wikimedia Commons SVG files under CC0-1.0;
- one Wikimedia Commons WAV file under CC0-1.0.

The authoritative per-asset lineage, versions, authors, license URLs, and hashes are recorded in `data/multimodal_training_data/public_sources.csv`. The repository-level Apache 2.0 license does not replace the per-asset metadata.

To re-download the public assets and verify that their bytes still match the pinned hashes:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_multimodal_training_data.py --refresh
```

Refreshing is the only step that requires network access. An upstream change causes the script to fail instead of silently replacing the snapshot.

## Documentation

- [English tutorial](docs/multimodal_training_data.en.md)
- [中文教程](docs/multimodal_training_data.zh-CN.md)

The tutorials describe the Arrow schemas, modality processors, Vane APIs, execution backends, output contract, parser scope, and source metadata.
