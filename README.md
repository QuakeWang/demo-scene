# Vane Demo Scene

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

This repository showcases reproducible use cases built with [Vane](https://github.com/AstroVela/vane). Each demo illustrates how Vane can combine multimodal data and mixed compute workloads in unified `Relation` pipelines.

## Use Cases

### AI / Data Pipelines

* **[Auditable Multimodal Claims Triage with Vane](claims-disposition)** — Turns PostgreSQL claim records and MinIO photos and documents into reviewable workflow recommendations using stateful OCR, multimodal fact extraction, and deterministic SQL rules. **Choose this when** you need an end-to-end claims triage workflow with explicit approve, deny, request-more-materials, and manual-review paths.

* **[Procurement Conflict-of-Interest and Scoring Anomaly Audit with Vane](procurement-compliance-audit)** — Reconciles supplier score tables with recommendation and committee evidence extracted from images, then recalculates rankings and produces deterministic audit findings. **Choose this when** you need to combine documentary evidence with numeric scoring to surface explainable compliance review signals.

* **[Claims Evidence Graph with Vane](claims-evidence-graph)** — Normalizes claim photos, scanned documents, and attachment metadata into auditable evidence tables, validation reports, and human-review tasks, with optional VLM image analysis. **Choose this when** you need a reusable claims evidence and data quality layer rather than a final workflow recommendation.

* **[Multimodal Training Data Release with Vane](multimodal-training-data)** — Processes document, text, image, and audio assets in typed Relation branches, then publishes accepted records and reviewable rejection artifacts with source lineage. **Choose this when** you are curating a multimodal training or evaluation dataset and need reproducible quality gates and release manifests.

* **[Banking Voice Analysis with Vane and Jev](banking-voice-pipeline)** — Turns short Chinese banking recordings into reviewable business fields through CPU decoding, GPU Whisper transcription, native Jev judgments, and deterministic SQL queue mapping, with a keyword baseline that shares the same transcripts. **Choose this when** you need structured, human-reviewable judgments from call audio with an external model service.

* **[Enterprise Agent Evidence Governance with Vane](enterprise-agent-evidence)** — Joins multimodal assets to business requirements, detects missing, conflicting, stale, or risky evidence, and produces governed Agent context and an ordered review queue. **Choose this when** an enterprise Agent needs a vetted context layer before retrieval or model execution.

* **[Web Text Deduplication with Vane](web-text-deduplication)** — Finds exact and near-duplicate documents with MinHash, LSH candidate generation, exact Jaccard verification, and graph clustering, then selects stable representatives. **Choose this when** you need to clean a web or document corpus while retaining candidate diagnostics and reviewable duplicate clusters.

## Repository Policy

This repository is intended to be public. Demo code, synthetic fixtures, documentation, and small configuration files can live in Git. Generated outputs, virtual environments, model weights, private data, and licensed datasets that cannot be redistributed must stay out of the repository.
