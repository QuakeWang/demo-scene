# Web Text Deduplication

Web corpora accumulate exact copies, lightly edited revisions, mirrored pages, and repeated templates. Comparing every pair gives quadratic work, while a content hash only finds byte-identical records. This example uses Vane Relations, deterministic MinHash fingerprints, global LSH candidate generation, exact Jaccard verification, and graph clustering to produce an auditable deduplicated release.

## Example data

The default `documents.csv` contains 24 repository-authored documents under Apache-2.0. It uses reserved `.example` domains, and `scripts/prepare_web_text_deduplication_fixture.py` generates the text in the repository. `documents_snapshot.json` pins the CSV hash, row count, schema, and expected pipeline results.

The file contains:

- six topics with a canonical document, an exact cross-domain mirror, and a one-token revision;
- six unrelated singleton documents;
- four reserved synthetic domains.

The fixture is small enough for fast CI but exercises exact duplicates, near duplicates, cross-domain candidates, singleton clusters, representative selection, and the global pair-space diagnostics.

An optional Common Crawl mode reads prepared WARC byte ranges into the same pipeline. It is networked, opt-in, and keeps generated text under `workspace/`.

The input contract is:

~~~text
doc_id, source, domain, crawled_at, title, body
~~~

Vane 0.1.0's RayRunner cannot serialize a CSV scan, so CSV input is read as strings with Arrow, staged as Parquet, and then exposed as a Relation:

~~~python
from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

from src._common import RunnerWorkspace, read_csv_as_strings

workspace_dir = TemporaryDirectory(prefix="vane-web-dedup-ray-")
workspace = RunnerWorkspace(Path(workspace_dir.name), conn)
documents = workspace.stage_table(
    "input-documents", read_csv_as_strings(DEFAULT_INPUT)
).project(
    "doc_id, source, domain, cast(crawled_at as date) as crawled_at, "
    "coalesce(title, '') as title, coalesce(body, '') as body"
)
~~~

`doc_id` must be non-null and unique. Custom CSV and Parquet inputs use the same base columns; optional WARC lineage columns are preserved when present.

## 1. Normalize and fingerprint

The first Batch UDF normalizes `body`, creates 5-token shingles, calculates 64 deterministic BLAKE2b-64 MinHash values with seed 42, and divides the signature into eight bands of eight rows:

~~~python
fingerprinted_rel = documents.map_batches(
    importable_fingerprint_documents_batch(),
    schema=FINGERPRINT_SCHEMA,
    batch_size=args.batch_size,
    **udf_options,
)
~~~

The normalization sequence is Unicode NFD, combining-mark removal, lowercase, punctuation-to-space, and whitespace collapse. Empty text receives an empty band list and never enters an LSH bucket. A document with fewer than five tokens receives one ordered whole-document shingle, so `alpha beta` and `beta alpha` remain different.

For eight bands with eight rows each, the theoretical candidate probability is `1-(1-s^8)^8`. At the exact acceptance threshold `s=0.7`, that probability is `0.378122`. This is a recall tradeoff under the MinHash independence assumption, not a measured accuracy claim.

## 2. Expand bands and guard candidate growth

The fixed eight-band signature is expanded with eight SQL projections using `list_extract(f.lsh_bands, ...)`. RayRunner materializes each projection, and a multi-file Parquet scan combines the results:

~~~python
band_queries = [
    f"""
    select
      f.doc_id,
      d.domain,
      {band_index} as band_index,
      list_extract(f.lsh_bands, {band_index + 1}) as lsh_band
    from fingerprinted f
    join documents d using (doc_id)
    where f.shingle_count > 0
    """
    for band_index in range(8)
]

band_paths = [
    workspace.write_relation(f"band-{index}", relation)
    for index, relation in enumerate(band_membership_relations(conn))
]
band_memberships = conn.read_parquet([str(path) for path in band_paths])
~~~

The pipeline verifies that every non-empty fingerprint produces exactly eight membership rows. `collision_buckets.csv` exposes member counts, domains, and the potential pair expansion for each colliding bucket. Ray/SQL filters singleton buckets first. Only memberships from colliding buckets are collected for deterministic grouping on the driver and staged back to Parquet; the rest of the data pipeline remains on RayRunner.

Before the self-join, the script sums `member_count * (member_count - 1) / 2` across buckets. If `candidate_pair_slots` exceeds `--max-candidate-pair-slots`, execution fails before creating the pair relation. The default budget is 1,000,000.

## 3. Generate global candidates

Candidates are joined globally rather than partitioned by domain, allowing the pipeline to find mirrored content:

~~~sql
select
  l.doc_id as left_doc_id,
  r.doc_id as right_doc_id,
  l.domain as left_domain,
  r.domain as right_domain,
  count(*) as shared_bands
from band_memberships l
join band_memberships r
  on l.band_index = r.band_index
 and l.lsh_band = r.lsh_band
 and l.doc_id < r.doc_id
group by l.doc_id, r.doc_id, l.domain, r.domain
~~~

`l.doc_id < r.doc_id` removes self-pairs and symmetric duplicates. Grouping merges pairs that collide in several bands.

`candidate_summary.csv` compares the unique candidates with the global `n(n-1)/2` pair space and records `candidate_reduction_ratio`. `domain_summary.csv` provides a per-domain diagnostic but does not replace the global baseline.

## 4. Verify with exact Jaccard

The second Batch UDF computes:

- exact Jaccard over the full 5-token shingle sets, or the single ordered whole-document shingle used for shorter non-empty text;
- MinHash signature overlap as a diagnostic.

Only exact Jaccard at or above 0.7 creates a duplicate edge. A high approximate score alone is recorded as `minhash_only_rejected`.

~~~python
scored_pairs_rel = candidate_pairs.map_batches(
    importable_score_pairs_batch(),
    schema=SCORED_PAIR_SCHEMA,
    batch_size=100,
    **udf_options,
)
~~~

This separates candidate recall from final acceptance and leaves an auditable reason on every scored pair.

## 5. Build stable clusters

Duplicate edges form an undirected graph. The pipeline already collects all sorted document IDs on the driver, and `--max-candidate-pair-slots` bounds edge expansion. `build_cluster_relation` therefore reads the accepted edges once, computes connected components with a deterministic union-find, and stages one Parquet Relation:

~~~python
clusters = build_cluster_relation(conn, workspace)
clusters.create_view("clusters", replace=True)
~~~

Union always attaches the larger root to the smaller one, so the smallest member `doc_id` becomes the stable cluster root regardless of edge order. Path compression avoids repeated full-graph materialization, and only the final membership table crosses back into RayRunner. Representative selection is separate: newer crawl date wins, then higher token count, then `doc_id`. `cluster_inspection.csv` shows every multi-member cluster, its chosen representative, members, and weakest accepted edge.

## Default results

The pinned fixture produces:

~~~text
Source WARC records: 0
Text blocks: 24
Global pair space: 276
Candidate pair slots: 80 / 1000000
LSH candidate pairs: 18
Candidate reduction: 93.48%
Duplicate pairs: 18
Clusters: 12
Output directory: output/web_text_deduplication
~~~

The 18 duplicate edges contain six exact pairs and twelve near-duplicate pairs. The 24 input documents form six three-member duplicate clusters and six singletons, leaving 12 representatives.

These numbers are a deterministic contract for code and CI. They are not a precision, recall, throughput, or web-scale benchmark.

## Outputs

RayRunner evaluates the Relation outputs. The driver-side cluster memberships are staged as Parquet before downstream SQL; other Parquet artifacts use Relation writers, and `workspace.write_csv` writes a fresh Ray projection through Arrow:

~~~python
workspace.write_csv(duplicate_pairs, output_dir / "duplicate_pairs.csv")
workspace.write_csv(
    cluster_inspection, output_dir / "cluster_inspection.csv"
)
workspace.write_csv(
    collision_buckets, output_dir / "collision_buckets.csv"
)
workspace.write_csv(domain_summary, output_dir / "domain_summary.csv")
workspace.write_parquet(
    fingerprinted, output_dir / "fingerprinted.parquet"
)
workspace.write_parquet(
    representatives, output_dir / "deduped_documents.parquet"
)
~~~

## Run

Install dependencies and run the offline fixture:

The validated setup resolves Vane 0.1.0 and its dependencies from PyPI.

~~~bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install 'vane-ai==0.1.0'
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip check
.venv/bin/python src/web_text_deduplication.py
~~~

Vane 0.1.0 uses RayRunner by default. `--execution-backend auto` therefore resolves to `ray_task`; `ray_task` and `subprocess_task` can also be selected explicitly.

Focused tests:

~~~bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest -v \
  tests.test_web_text_deduplication \
  tests.test_common_crawl_source
~~~

Regenerate the repository-authored fixture:

~~~bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_web_text_deduplication_fixture.py
~~~

The fixture generator must reproduce the pinned hash and expected results.

## Optional Common Crawl run

This path is opt-in and networked. Review the [Common Crawl Terms of Use](https://commoncrawl.org/terms-of-use) and the selected source sites before running it.

The checked-in target list uses only IANA example domains. Generate the record manifest and extracted snapshot locally:

~~~bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_web_text_deduplication_data.py \
  --refresh-index \
  --acknowledge-common-crawl-terms
~~~

Generated files live under `workspace/web_text_deduplication/`, which is gitignored and has `redistribution_status=local_only_rights_review_required`. They should not be committed.

Run the verified local snapshot:

~~~bash
.venv/bin/python src/web_text_deduplication.py \
  --input workspace/web_text_deduplication/common_crawl_blocks.parquet \
  --snapshot-metadata workspace/web_text_deduplication/common_crawl_snapshot.json \
  --output-dir output/web_text_deduplication_common_crawl
~~~

Or read the prepared WARC ranges live:

~~~bash
.venv/bin/python src/web_text_deduplication.py \
  --source common-crawl \
  --record-manifest workspace/web_text_deduplication/common_crawl_records.csv \
  --acknowledge-common-crawl-terms \
  --output-dir output/web_text_deduplication_live
~~~

The WARC path checks HTTP 206, requested byte length, and target URI, and cross-checks the WARC payload-digest header against the pinned index digest. It also checks the HTML type, maximum payload size, and extraction row limits. When nested HTML elements both qualify as text blocks, the extractor prefers the deepest block and retains only direct text from a qualifying ancestor. It removes duplicate block text before applying the per-page row limit.

## Custom inputs

Supply any CSV or Parquet with the six base columns:

~~~bash
.venv/bin/python src/web_text_deduplication.py \
  --input path/to/documents.parquet \
  --output-dir output/custom_dedup
~~~

Custom input is marked `user_managed`. Add `--snapshot-metadata` to verify its path, byte size, SHA-256, row count, and optional WARC record manifest. Passing that verification does not reclassify custom data as `repository_fixture`; that label is reserved for the checked-in default input and metadata pair.

## Current scope

- The offline fixture makes behavior reproducible; it is not a representative web distribution.
- LSH is probabilistic. Exact scoring removes false positives among candidates but cannot recover pairs that never share a band.
- Hot buckets and driver-side graph state can become expensive. The pair-slot guard bounds candidate expansion, but this example is not a distributed-scale benchmark.
- The HTML extractor removes parent-child overlap but does not evaluate page safety, privacy, robots policy, or content rights.
