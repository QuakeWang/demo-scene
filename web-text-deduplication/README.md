# Web Text Deduplication with Vane

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Detect exact and near-duplicate text with deterministic MinHash fingerprints, global LSH candidates, exact Jaccard verification, and stable graph clusters. The pipeline writes candidate diagnostics, review tables, and a deduplicated representative release.

## Vane Data Focus

- Read the offline fixture as a Relation, with an optional custom data source for pinned Common Crawl WARC byte ranges.
- Compute MinHash fingerprints and exact pair scores through typed `map_batches` stages.
- Use SQL for global LSH candidate joins and pair-growth diagnostics, then build stable connected components with a bounded driver-side union-find before selecting representatives and writing artifacts.

## Example Data

The default fixture contains 24 repository-authored documents under Apache-2.0. It uses reserved `.example` domains and contains six exact/near-duplicate groups plus six singleton documents. Its schema, SHA-256, row count, license, data classification, and expected results are pinned in `data/web_text_deduplication/documents_snapshot.json`.

An optional Common Crawl workflow reads selected WARC byte ranges into the same pipeline. It is networked and opt-in; extracted third-party text is generated under the gitignored `workspace/` directory rather than committed to the repository.

## Quick Start

Python 3.12 and uv are used for the validated setup. Vane 0.1.0 and its dependencies are resolved from PyPI.

~~~bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install 'vane-ai==0.1.0'
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip check
.venv/bin/python src/web_text_deduplication.py
~~~

Expected summary:

~~~text
Source WARC records: 0
Text blocks: 24
Global pair space: 276
Candidate pair slots: 80 / 1000000
LSH candidate pairs: 18
Candidate reduction: 93.48%
Duplicate pairs: 18
Clusters: 12
Output directory: output/web_text_deduplication
~~~

The 18 accepted edges contain six exact and twelve near-duplicate pairs. The pipeline retains 12 representatives.

Run the focused tests:

~~~bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*crawl*.py' -v
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_web_text_deduplication.py' -v
~~~

## Algorithm

The default data flow is:

~~~text
verified document fixture
→ normalization and 5-token shingles
→ 64-value MinHash signature
→ 8 × 8 LSH bands
→ guarded global candidate self-join
→ exact Jaccard acceptance
→ bounded driver-side union-find
→ stable representative selection
~~~

The self-join fails before expansion when collision buckets exceed `--max-candidate-pair-slots`. MinHash overlap remains diagnostic; only exact shingle Jaccard at or above 0.7 creates a duplicate edge.

Documents with fewer than five tokens use one ordered whole-document shingle. This preserves token order instead of collapsing short text into an unordered set of words.

## Outputs

The default run writes under `output/web_text_deduplication/`:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `source_blocks.parquet` | Normalized input relation |
| `fingerprinted.parquet` | Text, shingles, MinHash, and LSH bands |
| `collision_buckets.csv` | Hot-bucket and pair-expansion diagnostics |
| `candidate_summary.csv` | Global pair space, budget, and reduction |
| `domain_summary.csv` | Per-domain candidate diagnostics |
| `scored_pairs.parquet` | Exact and approximate candidate scores |
| `duplicate_pairs.csv` | Accepted duplicate graph edges |
| `clusters.csv` | Stable cluster membership |
| `cluster_inspection.csv` | Multi-member cluster review view |
| `deduped_documents.parquet` | Selected representatives |
| `manifest.json` | Source classification, snapshot checks, algorithm, counts, and backends |

## Optional Common Crawl Path

Review the [Common Crawl terms](https://commoncrawl.org/terms-of-use) and the selected source sites before enabling this networked path. The acknowledgement flag prevents accidental ingestion.

Generate a local manifest and snapshot from the checked-in IANA example-domain targets:

~~~bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_web_text_deduplication_data.py \
  --refresh-index \
  --acknowledge-common-crawl-terms
~~~

Run the verified local snapshot:

~~~bash
.venv/bin/python src/web_text_deduplication.py \
  --input workspace/web_text_deduplication/common_crawl_blocks.parquet \
  --snapshot-metadata workspace/web_text_deduplication/common_crawl_snapshot.json \
  --output-dir output/web_text_deduplication_common_crawl
~~~

The custom data source reads pinned WARC byte ranges, then a Batch UDF extracts non-overlapping HTML text blocks before deduplication.

Or replay its WARC ranges live:

~~~bash
.venv/bin/python src/web_text_deduplication.py \
  --source common-crawl \
  --record-manifest workspace/web_text_deduplication/common_crawl_records.csv \
  --acknowledge-common-crawl-terms \
  --output-dir output/web_text_deduplication_live
~~~

Generated files stay under `workspace/` and should not be committed. The tutorial covers snapshot verification, custom-input labels, and extraction details.
